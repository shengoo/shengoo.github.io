# How to Create a Javascript Console in Sublime Text - wikiHow

Two Methods:Using JSC (Mac OS X)Using Node.js

Javascript consoles are very handy for debugging and getting live results from your script. Although Sublime Text comes with build systems for many other scripting languages, it does not come with a built-in Javascript build system. Many sources will tell you to create a .html page with a link to the .js file, then use a web browser console to see the results of your code. This equates to constant window-switching and browser reloading; leading to frustration, heartache, and ultimately inefficiency.
